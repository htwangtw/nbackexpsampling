Welcome to our experiment.

In it you will be asked to attend to pairs of different shapes divided by a vertical line in the middle of the screen.  
You will only be required to keep your eyes in the centre of the screen and attend to the shapes most of the time.
When a reaction is required, the verticle line will change colour.We refer this as an event.

The condition will switch between blocks. The two types of conditions are 0-back and 1-back. 
When an event occurs in a 0-back block, the screen displays a pair of shapes and a smaller target item in the middle.
You answer according to the CURRENT screen.

When an event occurs in a 1-back block, the screen displays a pair of "?" and a smaller target item in the middle.
You answer according to the PREVIOUS screen.

There are two type of events, a location event and a recognition event. 
If the line is {COLOR_REC}, the trial is a Recognition event - please indicate weather the target is/was presented;
If the line is {COLOR_LOC}, the trial is a Location event - please indicate the location of the target.

When the fixation cross is {COLOR_REC}, the {KEY_REC_0} button indicates {RESP_REC_0}, the {KEY_REC_1} button indicates {RESP_REC_1}.
When the fixation cross is {COLOR_LOC}, When the fixation cross is {COLOR_REC}, the {KEY_REC_0} button indicates {RESP_REC_0}, the {KEY_REC_1} button indicates {RESP_REC_1}.hould try to be as quick and accurate as possible.

Press RETURN to start the task.
