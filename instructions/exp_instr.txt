Welcome to our experiment.

In it you will be asked to attend to pairs of different shapes of differnt textures, divided by a coloured vertical line in the middle of the screen. The vertical line will always be the same colour in the given condition. 
You will only be required to keep your eyes in the centre of the screen and attend to the shapes most of the time.

Depending on the condition when you are presented with a target or question mark(s) you must indicate:
	In BLUE CONDITION which side the target is on the CURRENT TRIAL;
	In BLACK CONDITION which stimulus was on the PREVIOUS TRIAL;
	In RED CONDITION which side the target was on the PREVIOUSTRIAL.

The target and the correct answer will be either completely identical, or share only one feature.

The left arrow button indicates LEFT, the right arrow button indicates RIGHT.
You should try to be as quick and accurate as possible.

Press RETURN to start the task.
