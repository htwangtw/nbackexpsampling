paradigm developed by Konishi and colleagues

2 - 4 experiment blocks (depending on the desired lenght)
The current block must be a different task from the previous block.

In a block there will be a certain number of micor-blocks. 
The completion of a go trial ends a micro-block.
In the whole experiemnt, 40% of the go trials should be questionnaires.
at the end of the final micro-block in the current block, show 2-5 no-go trials before switching to the next block/ ending experiment.

the structure of a micro-block:
    2 ~ 6 no-go trials
        jittered fixation cross
        jittered stimuli display
    go trial
        jittered fixation cross
        show either task or questionnaire
            1. task: a 2-choice task that participant needs to response to
            2. questionnaire: some questions of about their thought at this moment
