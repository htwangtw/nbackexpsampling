# Details of paradigm developed by Konishi and colleagues

- 2 - 4 experiment blocks (depending on the desired length)
- The current block must be a different condition from the previous block.

In a block there will be a certain number of micor-blocks.
The completion of a go trial or an experience sampling probe ends a micro-block.
In the whole experiemnt, 40% of the micor-blocks will end with experience sampling probes.
At the end of the final micro-block in the current block, show 2-5 no-go trials before switching to the next block/ ending experiment.

## the structure of a micro-block:
- 2 ~ 6 no-go trials
    - jittered fixation cross
    - jittered stimuli display
- a go trial / experience sampling probe
    - jittered fixation cross
    - show either task or experience sampling probe.
        1. task: a 2-choice task that participant needs to response to
        2. questionnaire: some questions of about their thought at this moment
